## bgfx

_See [go-bgfx](https://github.com/james4k/go-bgfx) for more
information._

[GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) is required to run the examples.

Installing and running the examples is simple, assuming you have your
$GOPATH/bin setup in $PATH:

```
$ go get github.com/james4k/go-bgfx-examples/...
$ bgfx-01-cubes
```

If you want to see the sources to the shaders used by the examples, for
now you should go to the original examples:
